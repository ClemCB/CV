## Clem Capel-Bird

Full Stack junior developer at Ascential and survivor of Makers Academy bootcamp, where I discovered a love of diagramming to problem solve and flair for learning new languages. Driven by creating quality software in a collaborative team.

I discovered my passion for tech in my first job as a project manager. I worked with the startup scene in Leeds, ran a trial of a click-and-collect app and worked with Google to launch its first Digital Garage in the UK.

It was fast-paced and challenging and brought me to London where I immersed myself in startup culture at YPlan, Zopa and Audible, absorbing everything I could from my talented developer colleagues.

## Skills

#### Understanding Humans

I've always excelled in roles where success demands solid communication skills. I enjoy building great working relationships and feel comfortable communicating with everyone in a team.

- Built relationships with hiring managers whilst working in in-house recruitment to understand their requirements and immersed myself in company culture to hire many talented members to the team
- Worked with internal and external stakeholders to deliver city centre improvement projects, such as safety improvements (lighting, repairs) to dark streets
- Adept at explaining technical concepts simply, having been on the other side as a non-tech person surrounded by developers


#### Analytical

- Award winner for excellent achievement in sociological research methods and social statistics
- Tracked and reported hiring statistics in recruitment roles, making successful recommendations to company CEOs

#### Project Management

- Kicked off my career in project management, working in business-facing teams, but now more passionate about Agile than Prince II.
- Project managed the successful one-month trial of a click-and-collect Android app at traditional market, tracking finances, working with stakeholders including the development team, customers and market traders.
